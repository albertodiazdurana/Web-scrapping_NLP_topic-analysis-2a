Apart from financial commitments, successful microfinance initiatives need a favourable framework and strong microfinance institutions to exhaust their full potential to grow. To achieve this goal, KfW Entwicklungsbank uses a variety of complementary approaches to support MFIs, the most important ones being “Greenfielding”, “Downscaling”, “Upgrading” and “Linkage”.

2012/Luxembourg/5//35.0/Non profit/NGO/"The Microinsurance Network’s mission is to promote the development and delivery of effective risk management tools, including insurance services, for unserved people.
To achieve this mission we:

Encourage shared learnings
Facilitate knowledge generation and dissemination
Provide a global multi-stakeholder platform

The network's work is anchored on four strategic outcomes, considered key for the sector to reach its full potential:

Increased supply of providers and products A diverse and growing number of providers offer a broader range of insurance services to an increasing number of low-income people.
Appropriate regulation and supervision for the microinsurance providers Regulators and supervisors at the international and national levels stimulate the provision of insurance services and protect clients.
Leveraging the recognition within global platforms that microinsurance is a key risk mitigation tool for the poor and unserved Governments, multilaterals and other global platforms incorporate microinsurance into strategies.
A performing and sustainable network  A thriving and growing network that provides high member value and is financially sustainable.

"//Programmes open to all regions.//"MFIs remain a key distribution channel for microinsurance and we are proud many MFIs are members of our network, including, for example, Pakistan Microfinance Network. The MiN’s objective is to promote the provision of responsible and inclusive insurance products and services. Ensuring that MFIs offer credit-life products or maintain other forms of insurance to manage their own exposure is one aspect of our work.
Another significant aspect is helping MFIs to develop products that provide better value to their clients, e.g. forms of income protection in addition to protecting the outstanding loan amount, better risk management practices, access to health insurance and helping to develop the capacity to help MFI clients manage risk holistically, particularly MSME clients.
We seek to achieve these objectives by providing a platform for knowledge exchange that is partly virtual, but increasingly practical through on-the-ground workshops and participation in conferences and, looking to the future, through targeted strategic communications to raise awareness of the need for inclusive insurance solutions that match the needs of low-income customers. This is closely allied with the broader development agenda that is expressed so articulately through the sustainable development goals for 2030.
We also produce research on the inclusive insurance market, notably the landscape of microinsurance, which measures market trends in terms of the evolution of service provision (no. of policies, etc.) and the state of microinsurance, which seeks to validate the impact of insurance on achieving specific development goals.

Forty-six years ago visionary entrepreneurs, Al Whittaker and David Bussau, founded Opportunity International around a revolutionary idea: making small loans to people who were too poor to access funding from financial institutions. Opportunity was a leading pioneer in developing microfinance as a sustainable method of alleviating poverty. Opportunity International is now a global non-profit organization that continues to help people in developing countries work their way out of poverty. Since 1971, the organization has provided more than $12 billion in loans to help 24 million clients launch and expand businesses, feed and educate their children and create jobs in their communities. Today, more than 10 million clients in 20 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe, are using an Opportunity International loan, savings account, insurance policy or training to improve their lives. Through microfinance and complementary products and services in education, agriculture and health, the organization has helped clients create or sustain 17.3 million jobs on the way to achieving its goal of 20 million jobs by 2020. More than 92 percent of Opportunity’s loan clients are women who would otherwise likely not have access to financial services because of legal and cultural gender inequities. The global organization has key offices in United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. The organization serves clients through a network of more than 23,000 people worldwide.

"/"In the following period, Partner will maintain the existing target population, including economically active micro entrepreneurs and households with difficult or no access to the commercial banks. Beside business start up loans or loans for spreading of businesses, Partner intends to continue to offer the clients loans for use of alternative energy sources and household energy efficiency improvement. This decision is based on the fact that micro enterprises in BiH use outdated or used equipment, while families mainly live in houses or apartments without appropriate insulation of heating/cooling system (over 80% of buildings in BiH [1]). The majority of used energy in households goes for heating and lights.
The level of energy consumption indicates the living standard, so it may be used as the indicator that some BiH citizens live below the poverty line. Low income populations use less energy than what is needed to meet their basic needs. The usage of wood for heating is very common in BiH, particularly in poor households. Energy used by households and the commercial sector is used (mostly) for heating (heating and the treatment of water and cooking), lights as well as electrical appliances and equipment[2].

Over the last 200 years, German Savings Banks have developed into one of the largest financial groups worldwide, successfully combining a high degree of professionalism with a strong social mandate. The mission of the Sparkassenstiftung für internationale Kooperation (Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation - SBFIC) is to make the German Savings Banks experience accessible to similar financial institutions in developing and transition countries. To this end, the Sparkassenstiftung provides state-of-the-art training and services to its partner institutions around the globe.
Objective:
The Sparkassenstiftung aims to enhance the professional capacity of its partner institutions, empowering them to offer their customers permanent access to financial services. In particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), but also poor population strata and social fringe groups belong to the target groups of the Sparkassenstiftung's partner institutions. Focusing business operations on the SME sector and small-income earners actually benefits the partner institutions themselves: serving small businesses and private clients allows the generation of stable and sufficient profits on a sustainable basis.

Rooted in our deep understanding of the women’s market, we tackle financial inclusion in three interconnected ways: first, by partnering with financial services providers to develop scalable market-driven solutions; second, through our gender-lens private equity fund; and, finally, because diverse institutions are proven to be stronger, we build institutional capacity through leadership and diversity programs. Through this holistic approach and our global reach of 49 institutions in 31 countries, we accelerate economic opportunity for low-income women and growth for financial service providers in the emerging markets.

The NGO will be piloting and scaling up programs in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia, amongst our other current priority markets. Since greater gender financial inclusion requires proactive and skilled management, it will also be expanding its leadership and development programs, helping women reach higher levels of influence at both the household and organizational levels. Last but not least, Women’s World Banking is pioneering innovative solutions to the barriers of financial exclusion, taking full advantage and harnessing the power of global technological gains.
