The MiN’s objective is to promote the provision of responsible and inclusive insurance products and services. Ensuring that MFIs offer credit-life products or maintain other forms of insurance to manage their own exposure is one aspect of our work.\\nAnother significant aspect is helping MFIs to develop products that provide better value to their clients, e.g. forms of income protection in addition to protecting the outstanding loan amount, better risk management practices, access to health insurance and helping to develop the capacity to help MFI clients manage risk holistically, particularly MSME clients.\\nWe seek to achieve these objectives by providing a platform for knowledge exchange that is partly virtual, but increasingly practical through on-the-ground workshops and participation in conferences and, looking to the future, through targeted strategic communications to raise awareness of the need for inclusive insurance solutions that match the needs of low-income customers. This is closely allied with the broader development agenda that is expressed so articulately through the sustainable development goals for 2030.\\nWe also produce research on the inclusive insurance market, notably the landscape of microinsurance, which measures market trends in terms of the evolution of service provision (no. of policies, etc.) and the state of microinsurance, which seeks to validate the impact of insurance on achieving specific development goals.\\n</td>\n",

Opportunity was a leading pioneer in developing microfinance as a sustainable method of alleviating poverty. Opportunity International is now a global non-profit organization that continues to help people in developing countries work their way out of poverty. Since 1971, the organization has provided more than $12 billion in loans to help 24 million clients launch and expand businesses, feed and educate their children and create jobs in their communities. Today, more than 10 million clients in 20 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe, are using an Opportunity International loan, savings account, insurance policy or training to improve their lives. Through microfinance and complementary products and services in education, agriculture and health, the organization has helped clients create or sustain 17.3 million jobs on the way to achieving its goal of 20 million jobs by 2020. More than 92 percent of Opportunity’s loan clients are women who would otherwise likely not have access to financial services because of legal and cultural gender inequities. The global organization has key offices in United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. The organization serves clients through a network of more than 23,000 people worldwide.

This decision is based on the fact that micro enterprises in BiH use outdated or used equipment, while families mainly live in houses or apartments without appropriate insulation of heating/cooling system (over 80% of buildings in BiH [1]). The majority of used energy in households goes for heating and lights.\\nThe level of energy consumption indicates the living standard, so it may be used as the indicator that some BiH citizens live below the poverty line. Low income populations use less energy than what is needed to meet their basic needs. The usage of wood for heating is very common in BiH, particularly in poor households. Energy used by households and the commercial sector is used (mostly) for heating (heating and the treatment of water and cooking), lights as well as electrical appliances and equipment[2].\\n[1] Source: http://www.energetska-efikasnost.ba/Publikacije/Vodic%20za%20energetski%...\\n[2]Strategic plan and programme for development of energy sector of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ministry of energy, mining and industry of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and expert group, 2008.\\n</td>\n",

The mission of the Sparkassenstiftung für internationale Kooperation (Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation - SBFIC) is to make the German Savings Banks experience accessible to similar financial institutions in developing and transition countries. To this end, the Sparkassenstiftung provides state-of-the-art training and services to its partner institutions around the globe.\\nObjective:\\nThe Sparkassenstiftung aims to enhance the professional capacity of its partner institutions, empowering them to offer their customers permanent access to financial services. In particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), but also poor population strata and social fringe groups belong to the target groups of the Sparkassenstiftung's partner institutions. Focusing business operations on the SME sector and small-income earners actually benefits the partner institutions themselves: serving small businesses and private clients allows the generation of stable and sufficient profits on a sustainable basis.\\n</td>\n",

It goes beyond microcredit and aims at integrating MFIs into local financial markets. KfW’s vision is to develop a healthy microfinance sector including a number of full-fledged deposit-taking MFIs. Apart from financial commitments, successful microfinance initiatives need a favourable framework and strong microfinance institutions to exhaust their full potential to grow. To achieve this goal, KfW Entwicklungsbank uses a variety of complementary approaches to support MFIs, the most important ones being “Greenfielding”, “Downscaling”, “Upgrading” and “Linkage”.\\n   \n",

Opportunity was a leading pioneer in developing microfinance as a sustainable method of alleviating poverty. Opportunity International is now a global non-profit organization that continues to help people in developing countries work their way out of poverty. Since 1971, the organization has provided more than $12 billion in loans to help 24 million clients launch and expand businesses, feed and educate their children and create jobs in their communities. Today, more than 10 million clients in 20 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe, are using an Opportunity International loan, savings account, insurance policy or training to improve their lives. Through microfinance and complementary products and services in education, agriculture and health, the organization has helped clients create or sustain 17.3 million jobs on the way to achieving its goal of 20 million jobs by 2020. More than 92 percent of Opportunity’s loan clients are women who would otherwise likely not have access to financial services because of legal and cultural gender inequities. The global organization has key offices in United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. The organization serves clients through a network of more than 23,000 people worldwide.

The mission of the Sparkassenstiftung für internationale Kooperation (Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation - SBFIC) is to make the German Savings Banks experience accessible to similar financial institutions in developing and transition countries. To this end, the Sparkassenstiftung provides state-of-the-art training and services to its partner institutions around the globe.\\nObjective:\\nThe Sparkassenstiftung aims to enhance the professional capacity of its partner institutions, empowering them to offer their customers permanent access to financial services. In particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), but also poor population strata and social fringe groups belong to the target groups of the Sparkassenstiftung's partner institutions. Focusing business operations on the SME sector and small-income earners actually benefits the partner institutions themselves: serving small businesses and private clients allows the generation of stable and sufficient profits on a sustainable basis.\\n   \n",

That is our mission. We believe that people can build independent livelihoods, provided their rights are respected. That is why we help people around the world to stand up for their rights.\\n1. Right to sustainable livelihood resources Everybody must be sure of a fair income and enough to eat. That is why we are working on better access to land and water, and on fair working and trading conditions.\\n2. Right to basic social services Education and health care are essential for building better societies. Yet even as we make progress towards universal primary education, around the world, there are still 130 million kids in school who fail to learn basic reading, writing and maths. Oxfam together with partner organizations invest in quality basic social services.\\n3. Right to life and security Natural disasters, climate change and armed conflicts hit millions of people every year. We support them with relief aid and reconstruction. And we prepare people to prevent or mitigate the effects of disasters and conflicts.\\n4. Right to social and political participation Knowledge is power. We believe that when people can participate in public decisions that affect them, they can build independent livelihoods and thriving communities.Together with partners we give people access to information and a voice.\\n5. Right to an identity Gender inequality is both a violation of human rights and an obstacle to sustainable development. In a just world there is no place for the discrimination of women and minorities.\\n   \n",

Through this holistic approach and our global reach of 49 institutions in 31 countries, we accelerate economic opportunity for low-income women and growth for financial service providers in the emerging markets.\\n   \n",

Its fundamental goals are eradicating poverty, reducing social inequalities and inequities between people and between communities, promoting gender equality, defending human rights, and achieving the sustainable human development of impoverished countries.\\nFONPRODE was created in 2010 and has taken over the actions approved both by the former Development Aid Fund (FAD)—which are attributable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation—and by the Microcredit Fund (FCM).\\n   \n",

This is why we have been focusing considerably energy and resources in better understanding how insurance services can be extended to the low-income market, and analysing the extent to which the working poor can benefit from insurance.\\nThe ILO's \"Making Microfinance Work\" training is highly acclaimed programme to build the capacity of middle managers and support the development of product diversification.\\n   \n",

The MiN’s objective is to promote the provision of responsible and inclusive insurance products and services. Ensuring that MFIs offer credit-life products or maintain other forms of insurance to manage their own exposure is one aspect of our work.\\nAnother significant aspect is helping MFIs to develop products that provide better value to their clients, e.g. forms of income protection in addition to protecting the outstanding loan amount, better risk management practices, access to health insurance and helping to develop the capacity to help MFI clients manage risk holistically, particularly MSME clients.\\nWe seek to achieve these objectives by providing a platform for knowledge exchange that is partly virtual, but increasingly practical through on-the-ground workshops and participation in conferences and, looking to the future, through targeted strategic communications to raise awareness of the need for inclusive insurance solutions that match the needs of low-income customers. This is closely allied with the broader development agenda that is expressed so articulately through the sustainable development goals for 2030.\\nWe also produce research on the inclusive insurance market, notably the landscape of microinsurance, which measures market trends in terms of the evolution of service provision (no. of policies, etc.) and the state of microinsurance, which seeks to validate the impact of insurance on achieving specific development goals.\\n   \n",

Guiding principles on which we base our work are Sharing, Ecumenical spirit, Grassroots, People, Integrity and Creation. Oikocredit is one of the world’s largest sources of private funding to the microfinance sector. We lend working capital to MFIs all over the world. We also provide credit to trade cooperatives, fair trade organisations and SMEs in the developing world. We aim to offer a dual return to our investors: financial and social. In addition to earning modest financial returns, investors are secure in the knowledge that their money is being used to fight poverty, promote fair trade and respect our planet's natural resources.\\nThe cooperative has a long history as a social and ethical investment fund, dating from 1975, when microfinance was in its infancy. Specific know-how and expertise has been developed over time in supporting financial institutions involved with agricultural finance, housing loans, SME, wholesale etc. In addition, Oikocredit has built up expertise in other forms of social enterprise finance such as fair trade producers, agricultural cooperatives in the south, hospitals and universities.

       "69   In the following period, Partner will maintain the existing target population, including economically active micro entrepreneurs and households with difficult or no access to the commercial banks. Beside business start up loans or loans for spreading of businesses, Partner intends to continue to offer the clients loans for use of alternative energy sources and household energy efficiency improvement. This decision is based on the fact that micro enterprises in BiH use outdated or used equipment, while families mainly live in houses or apartments without appropriate insulation of heating/cooling system (over 80% of buildings in BiH [1]). The majority of used energy in households goes for heating and lights.\\nThe level of energy consumption indicates the living standard, so it may be used as the indicator that some BiH citizens live below the poverty line. Low income populations use less energy than what is needed to meet their basic needs. The usage of wood for heating is very common in BiH, particularly in poor households. Energy used by households and the commercial sector is used (mostly) for heating (heating and the treatment of water and cooking), lights as well as electrical appliances and equipment[2].\\n[1] Source: http://www.energetska-efikasnost.ba/Publikacije/Vodic%20za%20energetski%...\\n[2]Strategic plan and programme for development of energy sector of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ministry of energy, mining and industry of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and expert group, 2008.\\n   \n",

Even though our core-product, the YAPU platform (offered as SaaS) can already digitalize the whole credit cycle and allows for a detailed cashflow analysis as well as the evaluation of farming practices, it does have a long back log. Among others, it comprises detailed risk maps as well as AI-supported analysis.\\n   \n",

       "Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (AECID)  Combating poverty is the main goal of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID).\\nThe Fund for the Promotion of Development (FONPRODE) makes a set of instruments available to the Spanish Cooperation, involving both reimbursable transactions—basically loans and capital transactions—and donations, in order to contribute to achieving this goal.\\nFONPRODE is a dedicated instrument at the service of the entire Spanish Cooperation system, exclusively dedicated to operations of an untied nature. Its fundamental goals are eradicating poverty, reducing social inequalities and inequities between people and between communities, promoting gender equality, defending human rights, and achieving the sustainable human development of impoverished countries.\\nFONPRODE was created in 2010 and has taken over the actions approved both by the former Development Aid Fund (FAD)—which are attributable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation—and by the Microcredit Fund (FCM).\\n   \n",

       "Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (AECID)  Combating poverty is the main goal of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID).\\nThe Fund for the Promotion of Development (FONPRODE) makes a set of instruments available to the Spanish Cooperation, involving both reimbursable transactions—basically loans and capital transactions—and donations, in order to contribute to achieving this goal.\\nFONPRODE is a dedicated instrument at the service of the entire Spanish Cooperation system, exclusively dedicated to operations of an untied nature. Its fundamental goals are eradicating poverty, reducing social inequalities and inequities between people and between communities, promoting gender equality, defending human rights, and achieving the sustainable human development of impoverished countries.\\nFONPRODE was created in 2010 and has taken over the actions approved both by the former Development Aid Fund (FAD)—which are attributable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation—and by the Microcredit Fund (FCM).\\n   \n",

       "Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (AECID)  Combating poverty is the main goal of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID).\\nThe Fund for the Promotion of Development (FONPRODE) makes a set of instruments available to the Spanish Cooperation, involving both reimbursable transactions—basically loans and capital transactions—and donations, in order to contribute to achieving this goal.\\nFONPRODE is a dedicated instrument at the service of the entire Spanish Cooperation system, exclusively dedicated to operations of an untied nature. Its fundamental goals are eradicating poverty, reducing social inequalities and inequities between people and between communities, promoting gender equality, defending human rights, and achieving the sustainable human development of impoverished countries.\\nFONPRODE was created in 2010 and has taken over the actions approved both by the former Development Aid Fund (FAD)—which are attributable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation—and by the Microcredit Fund (FCM).\\n   \n",
